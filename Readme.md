Stuart's Game Engine
====================

Work-in-progress Game Engine project. Very much a learning experience for
enjoyment, not intended for serious use, but I've licensed it as 3-clause
BSD so if any of it is useful, have at it.

Utilities:

- Math: 2D/3D Vectors, Quaternion, Square Matrices
- Bounds Testing: Circles, Rectangles, Spheres, Axis Aligned Boxes
- 2D Noise: Perlin, Worley
- Geometry: Vertex, Mesh
- String utilities

Rendering:

- GLSL Shader support
- Texturing (via SDL2_image)
- Mesh Rendering, Wavefront .obj importer
- Debug Graphics: Simple Line drawing

UI:

- Window Creation and Input Handling (via SDL2)
