How to Build
------------

First, run the deps script from the top folder to download 3rd party libraries.

    project$ ./deps.sh

Use CMake and prefer building out of the source tree. i.e:

    project$ mkdir build
    project$ cd build
    project/build$ cmake ..
    project/build$ make

To run tests after build:

    project/build$ ./SGEngine/Test/SGEngineTest
