How to Build
------------

Use CMake and prefer building out of the source tree. i.e:

    project$ mkdir build
    project$ cd build
    project/build$ cmake ..
    project/build$ make

The CMake command will automatically download GoogleTest into the External folder at configuration time.

To run tests after build:

    project/build$ ./SGEngine/Test/SGEngineTest
