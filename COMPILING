How to Build
------------

Use CMake and prefer building out of the source tree. i.e:

    project$ mkdir build
    project$ cd build
    project/build$ cmake ..
    project/build$ make

The CMake command will run deps.pl and install dependencies to the External/ dir
at configuration time.

To run tests after build:

    project/build$ make tests

To run demo application:

    project/build$ ln -sf ../Examples/HelloWorld/data data
    project/build$ ./Examples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld
